Learning how to code WELL

Btw, the [whole course](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ubcx-software-development) is based on the book called ["How to Design Programs", Second Edition](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/index.html). Check it out!

p.s. I dropped the course (it was kinda too easy for me and thus too boring) and finished the Programming Languages courses instead ([A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages/),[B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b/),[C](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c/)). These are wonderful! htcsd is cool too though, maybe I'll revisit it and finish it someday.
