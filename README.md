Learning how to code WELL

Btw, the [whole course](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ubcx-software-development) is based on the book called ["How to Design Programs", Second Edition](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/index.html). Check it out!

p.s. I dropped the course and finished the Programming Languages courses ([A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages/),[B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b/),[C](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c/)).
